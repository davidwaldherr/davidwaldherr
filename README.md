- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidwaldherr

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how the knowledge of coding languages enhances one's possibility for creative imagination.
While imagination may be more important than knowledge, yet knowledge empowers imagination.
Learning how to code has accelerated this cycle for me.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React-Three Fiber to create 3D web experiences. My current ambition is to create a Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) dream journal using the OpenAI API in order to solve the problem of lucid dreaming.
