- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidwaldherr

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how the knowledge of coding languages alters one's possibility to creatively imagine new projects and ideas.
While imagination may be more important than knowledge, knowledge empowers imagination, and learning how to code has accelerated
this process for me

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development with HTML and CSS. I'm looking forward to breaking into Javascript so that I can animate
web pages and apps into interactive experiences.
