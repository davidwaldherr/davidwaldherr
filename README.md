- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidwaldherr

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how the knowledge of coding languages enhances one's possibility for creative imagination.
While imagination may be more important than knowledge, knowledge empowers imagination, and learning how to code has accelerates
this cycle.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development with HTML and CSS. I'm looking forward to breaking into Javascript so that I can animate
web pages and apps into interactive experiences.
