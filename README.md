# 👋 Hi, I’m @davidwaldherr


## 🪐 I’m interested in exploring how learning coding languages enhances one's possibility for creative imagination.

## 💠 While imagination may be more important than knowledge, knowledge empowers imagination.

## 🧬 Learning how to code has accelerated this cycle for me.


# 👑 Main Plot: I’m currently building ai-assisted "God Tools" at Centaur SEO.

## 🧭 Sidequest: My current ambition is to create an LLM/LVM dream journal in order to solve the opportunity of lucid dreaming.

### 📫 You can reach me at david@centaurseo.com
