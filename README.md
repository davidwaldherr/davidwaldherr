- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davidwaldherr

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in how the knowledge of coding languages enhances one's possibility for creative imagination.
While imagination may be more important than knowledge, knowledge empowers imagination, and learning how to code has accelerated
this cycle for me.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to integrate GPT3 APIs into code. In the meantime, I'm also using Treehouse to build my skills
for developing with Javascript and React.
